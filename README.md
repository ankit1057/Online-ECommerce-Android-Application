# Online-ECommerce-Android-Application
This is an android Ecommerce Application where you can put up anything for sale with a photo and description and the buyer's contact. You can also Browse the contents availble for sale at any time.


I have used Picasso Library for the smooth transitions in the Browsing List.
RecyclerView Library for the enhanced loading.
Parse for the backend storage of data of the items.

It is in beta state so it's still buggy.

Contribute to this project by forking.


This application uses fragments for the sets of layout and Floating Button Action with animations for better UI Experience.
